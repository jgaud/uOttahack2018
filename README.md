Powered by Python 3.6, Buggy Detector is a breakthrough in advances in home security technology.

Featuring facial recognition, speech recognition, and computer vision; Buggy Detector revolutionizes the way home security works. Buggy Detector actively monitors your home or establishment while you’re away. In case of intruders, Buggy Detector alerts you with an image of the trespasser.

Buggy Detector also features ParcelSpotter, a new solution to delivery parcel and boxes left at doorsteps. Via computer vision, Buggy Detector picks up on parcels (such as Amazon’s) left at the door and alerts you of its arrival alongside an image of it. Furthermore, it also actively monitors parcels ensuring their security and safety in your yard.
